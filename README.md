Perceptron machine learning algorithm and its evaluation on a data set with 100 images using randomly generated features

This repository implements code for Perceptron algorithm written in Java and it classifies each instance in the test set image.data according to the random generated features. 

The code can be execured through CLI by file entering the file name followed by training set file(e.g. java -jar Perceptron.jar image.data). Alternatively, Perceptron.jar file or the source code provided in the repository can be imported into a Java IDE (e.g. eclipse).
